I am a science teacher in Kunshan Development Zone Experimental Primary School. Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in chemistry at [Yancheng Teachers University](https://www.yctu.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interests mainly focus on guiding students to explore science and developing their scientific awareness.
